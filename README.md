# MasterThesis_MACSEC_Security_Analysis
This project uses the Tamarin Prover to formally verify MACsec (IEEE 802.1AE) and MKA (IEEE 802.1X-2020). The model defines protocol roles, key distribution, and Secure Channel operations under a Dolevâ€“Yao adversary. Properties such as secrecy, authenticity, replay protection, and PN monotonicity are specified as lemmas and analyzed.
